# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.


********** STARTING ***********
- Clone the repo 
- run `npm i` for dependencies
- first `npm run server` for server
- second `npm run dev` for FE
- You are good to go.

********** Used Technologies ***********
- Yup , Formik
- React Bootstrap
- React Hooks used for state management
- uuid for unique ids
- json server behaves like a real server because I added 300ms delay for responses
